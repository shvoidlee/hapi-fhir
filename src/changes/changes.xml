				<![CDATA[<b>API CHANGE:</b>]]> The "FHIR structures" for DSTU1 (the classes which model the
				resources and composite datatypes) have been moved out of the core JAR into their
				own JAR, in order to allow support for DEV resources, and DSTU2 resources when thast
				version is finalized. See

					<b>Deprocated API Removal</b>: The following classes (which were deprocated previously)
					have now been removed:
					<ul>
						<li><b>ISecurityManager</b>: If you are using this class, the same functionality
						is available through the more general purpose
						<a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/doc_rest_server_interceptor.html">server interceptor</a>
						capabilities.
						<li><b>CodingListParam</b>: This class was made redundant by the

						class, which can be used in its place.

				Profile generation on the server was not working due to IdDt being
				incorrectly used. Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for the pull request!
			</action>			
			<action type="add" issue="42" dev="wdebeau1">
				Profiles did not generate correctly if a resource definition class had a 
				defined extension which was of a composite type. Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for the pull request!

				Remove unnecessary IOException from narrative generator API. Thanks to
				Petro Mykhailysyn for the pull request!  
			</action>			
			<action type="add" issue="48" dev="wdebeau1">
				Introduced a new 
				<![CDATA[<code>@ProvidesResources</code>]]> annotation which can be added to
				resource provider and servers to allow them to declare additional resource
				classes they are able to serve. This is useful if you have a server which can
				serve up multiple classes for the same resource type (e.g. a server that sometimes
				returns a default Patient, but sometimes uses a custom subclass). 
				Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for the pull request!
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="49" dev="wdebeau1">
				Introduced a new 
				<![CDATA[<code>@Destroy</code>]]> annotation which can be added to
				a resource provider method. This method will be called by the server when it
				is being closed/destroyed (e.g. when the application is being undeployed, the
				container is being shut down, etc.) 
				Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for the pull request!
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Add a new method <![CDATA[handleException]]> to the server interceptor
				framework which allows interceptors to be notified of any exceptions and 
				runtime errors within server methods. Interceptors may optionally also
				override the default error handling behaviour of the RestfulServer.
			</action>
			<action dev="wdebeau1" type="add">
				Add constants to BaseResource for the "_id" search parameter which all resources
				should support.
			</action>			
			<action type="fix">
				DateRangeParam parameters on the server now return correct 
				<![CDATA[<code>getLowerBoundAsInstant()</code>]]>
				and 
				<![CDATA[<code>getUpperBoundAsInstant()</code>]]>
				values if a single unqualified value is passed in. For example, if
				a query containing 
				<![CDATA[<code>&birthdate=2012-10-01</code>]]> 
				is received, previously these two methods would both return the same
				value, but with this fix 
				<![CDATA[<code>getUpperBoundAsInstant()</code>]]>
				now returns the instant at 23:59:59.9999.				
			</action>			
			<action type="fix">
				Resource fields with a type of "*" (or Any) sometimes failed to parse if a 
				value type of "code" was used. Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for reporting!
			</action>
			<action type="add" dev="lmds">
				Remove dependency on JAXB libraries, which were used to parse and encode
				dates and times (even in the JSON parser). JAXB is built in to most JDKs
				but the version bundled with IBM's JDK is flaky and resulted in a number
				of problems when deploying to Websphere.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="50" dev="jjathman">
				Primitive datatypes now preserve their original string value when parsing resources,
				as well as containing the "parsed value". For instance, a DecimalDt field value of
				<![CDATA[<code>1.0000</code>]]> will be parsed into the corresponding 
				decimal value, but will also retain the original value with the corresponding
				level of precision. This allows vadliator rules to be applied to 
				original values as received "over the wire", such as well formatted but
				invalid dates, e.g. "2001-15-01". Thanks to Joe Athman for reporting and 
				helping to come up with a fix!
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				When using Generic Client, if performing a
				<![CDATA[create]]> or <![CDATA[update]]> operation using a String as the resource body,
				the client will auto-detect the FHIR encoding style and send an appropriate 
				<![CDATA[Content-Type]]> header.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="52">
				JPA module (and public HAPI-FHIR test server) were unable to process resource types
				where at least one search parameter has no path specified. These now correctly save
				(although the server does not yet process these params, and it should). Thanks to
				GitHub user shvoidlee for reporting and help with analysis!
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Generic/Fluent Client "create" and "update" method requests were not setting a content type header
			</action>
			<action type="add" issue="53" dev="petromykhailysyn">
				DateDt left precision value as <![CDATA[null]]> in the constructor
				<![CDATA[DateDt(Date)]]>.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				RESTful server now doesn't overwrite resource IDs if they are absolute. In other words, if
				a server's Resource Provider returns a resource with ID "Patient/123" it will be translated to
				"[base url]/Patient/123" but if the RP returns ID "http://foo/Patient/123" the ID will be
				returned exactly as is. Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for the suggestion!
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="55">
				JPA module Transaction operation was not correctly replacing logical IDs
				beginning with "cid:" with server assigned IDs, as required by the
				specification.
			</action>
			<action type="fix" dev="tahurac">
				<![CDATA[FhirTerser]]> did not visit or find children in contained resources when 
				searching a resource. This caused server implementations to not always return contained
				resources when they are included with a resource being returned.
			</action>
			<action type="add" dev="lmds">
				Add a method <![CDATA[String IResource#getResourceName()]]> which returns the name of the
				resource in question (e.g. "Patient", or "Observation"). This is intended as a 
				convenience to users. 
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Do not strip version from resource references in resources returned
				from server search methods. Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for reporting!
			</action>
			<action type="fix" dev="jjathman" issue="54">
				Correct an issue with the validator where changes to the underlying
				OperationOutcome produced by a validation cycle cause the validation
				results to be incorrect.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Client interceptors registered to an interface based client instance 
				were applied to other client instances for the same client interface as well. (Issue
				did not affect generic/fluent clients)
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="57">
				DateDt, DateTimeDt and types InstantDt types now do not throw an exception
				if they are used to parse a value with the wrong level of precision for
				the given type but do throw an exception if the wrong level of precision
				is passed into their constructors.<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				This means that HAPI FHIR can now successfully parse resources from external 
				sources that have the wrong level of precision, but will generate a validation
				error if the resource is validated. Thanks to Alexander Kley for the suggestion!
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Encoding a Binary resource without a content type set should not result in a NullPointerException. Thanks
				to Alexander Kley for reporting!
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Server gives a more helpful error message if multiple IResourceProvider implementations
				are provided for the same resource type. Thanks to wanghaisheng for the idea!

				JPA server did not correctly process _include requests if included 
				resources were present with a non-numeric identifier. Thanks to 
				Bill de Beaubien for reporting!
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="60">
				Client requests which include a resource/bundle body (e.g. create,
				update, transaction) were not including a charset in the content type
				header, leading to servers incorrectly assuming ISO-8859/1. Thanks to 
				shvoidlee for reporting!

		<release version="0.7" date="2014-Oct-23">
			<action type="add" issue="30">
				<![CDATA[<b>API CHANGE:</b>]]> The TagList class previously implemented ArrayList semantics,
				but this has been replaced with LinkedHashMap semantics. This means that the list of
				tags will no longer accept duplicate tags, but that tag order will still be
				preserved. Thanks to Bill de Beaubien for reporting!
			</action>			
			<action type="fix" issue="33">
				Server was incorrectly including contained resources being returned as both contained resources, and as 
				top-level resources in the returned bundle for search operations.

				operations using an absolute URL. This allows developers to perform these operations using
				URLs they obtained from other sources (or external resource references within resources). In
				addition, the existing read/vread operations will now access absolute URL references if
				they are passed in. Thanks to Doug Martin of the Regenstrief Center for Biomedical Informatics
				for contributing this implementation!
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Server implementation was not correctly figuring out its own FHIR Base URL when deployed
				on Amazon Web Service server. Thanks to Jeffrey Ting and Bill De Beaubien of
				Systems Made Simple for their help in figuring out this issue!

				a primitive type child. Thanks to Jeffrey Ting and Bill De Beaubien of
				Systems Made Simple for their help in figuring out this issue!

				HAPI now runs successfully on Servlet 2.5 containers (such as Tomcat 6). Thanks to
				Bernard Gitaadji for reporting and diagnosing the issue!

				Summary (in the bundle entry) is now encoded by the XML and JSON parsers if supplied. Thanks to David Hay of 
				Orion Health for reporting this!
			</action>
			<action type="fix" issue="24">
				Conformance profiles which are automatically generated by the server were missing a few mandatory elements,

				for reporting this!				
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				XHTML (in narratives) containing escapable characters (e.g. &lt; or &quot;) will now always have those characters 
				escaped properly in encoded messages.
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Resources containing entities which are not valid in basic XML (e.g. &amp;sect;) will have those
				entities converted to their equivalent unicode characters when resources are encoded, since FHIR does
				not allow extended entities in resource instances.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Add a new client interceptor which adds HTTP Authorization Bearer Tokens (for use with OAUTH2 servers)
				to client requests.
			</action>			
			<action type="fix">
				Add phloc-commons dependency explicitly, which resolves an issue building HAPI from source on
				some platforms. Thanks to Odysseas Pentakalos for the patch!

				JSON-encoded contained resources with the incorrect "_id" element (which should be "id", but some
				incorrect examples exist on the FHIR specification) now parse correctly. In other words, HAPI

				"_id" element just to be more lenient.				
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Several unit tests failed on Windows (or any platform with non UTF-8 default encoding). This may

			<action type="add">
				Contained/included resource instances received by a client are now automatically 
				added to any ResourceReferenceDt instancea in other resources which reference them.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Add documentation on how to use eBay CORS Filter to support Cross Origin Resource
				Sharing (CORS) to server. CORS support that was built in to the server itself has
				been removed, as it did not work correctly (and was reinventing a wheel that others
				have done a great job inventing). Thanks to Peter Bernhardt of Relay Health for all the assistance
				in testing this!
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				IResource interface did not expose the getLanguage/setLanguage methods from BaseResource,

				JSON Parser now gives a more friendly error message if it tries to parse JSON with invalid use 
				of single quotes
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Transaction server method is now allowed to return an OperationOutcome in addition to the
				incoming resources. The public test server now does this in order to return status information
				about the transaction processing.
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				Update method in the server can now flag (via a field on the MethodOutcome object being returned)
				that the result was actually a creation, and Create method can indicate that it was actually an

			<action type="fix" dev="tahurac">
				Annotation client search methods with a specific resource type (e.g. List&lt;Patient&gt; search())
				won't return any resources that aren't of the correct type that are received in a response
				bundle (generally these are referenced resources, so they are populated in the reference fields instead).
				Thanks to Tahura Chaudhry of University Health Network for the unit test!

			<action type="add">
				Added narrative generator template for OperationOutcome resource
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Date/time types did not correctly parse values in the format "yyyymmdd" (although the FHIR-defined format
				is "yyyy-mm-dd" anyhow, and this is correctly handled). Thanks to Jeffrey Ting of Systems Made Simple
				for reporting! 
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Server search method for an unnamed query gets called if the client requests a named query
				with the same parameter list. Thanks to Neal Acharya of University Health Network for reporting!			
			</action>
			<action type="fix">
				Category header (for tags) is correctly read in client for "read" operation

				HAPI parsers now use field access to get/set values instead of method accessors and mutators.
				This should give a small performance boost.

			<action type="fix">
				JSON parser encodes resource references incorrectly, using the name "resource" instead

				Resource of type "List" failed to parse from a bundle correctly. Thanks to David Hay of Orion Health

				HAPI has a number of RESTful method parameter types that have similar but not identical
				purposes and confusing names. A cleanup has been undertaken to clean this up.
				This means that a number of existing classes
				have been deprocated in favour of new naming schemes.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All annotation-based clients and all server search method parameters are now named
				(type)Param, for example: StringParam, TokenParam, etc.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All generic/fluent client method parameters are now named
				(type)ClientParam, for example: StringClientParam, TokenClientParam, etc.
				<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>
				All renamed classes have been retained and deprocated, so this change should not cause any issues
				for existing applications but those applications should be refactored to use the

				<![CDATA[<b>BREAKING CHANGE:</b>]]>: IdDt has been modified so that it 
				contains a partial or complete resource identity. Previously it contained
				only the simple alphanumeric id of the resource (the part at the end of the "read" URL for
				that resource) but it can now contain a complete URL or even a partial URL (e.g. "Patient/123")
				and can optionally contain a version (e.g. "Patient/123/_history/456"). New methods have
				been added to this datatype which provide just the numeric portion. See the JavaDoc
				for more information. 
			</action>
			<action type="add">
				<![CDATA[<b>API CHANGE:</b>]]>: Most elements in the HAPI FHIR model contain
				a getId() and setId() method. This method is confusing because it is only actually used
				for IDREF elements (which are rare) but its name makes it easy to confuse with more
				important identifiers. For this reason, these methods have been deprocated and replaced with
				get/setElementSpecificId() methods. The old methods will be removed at some point. Resource
				types are unchanged and retain their get/setId methods.

			<action type="add">
				Allow use of QuantityDt as a service parameter to support the "quantity" type. Previously
