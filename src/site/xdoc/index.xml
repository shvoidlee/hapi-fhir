				This is the homepage for the HAPI-FHIR library. We are developing 
				an open-source implementation of the FHIR specification in Java. 
				This library is still in experimental stage, so please tread with caution.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Note that this is the home for the FHIR version of HAPI. If you are 
				looking for HL7 v2 support, <a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net">click here</a>.

					A public test server is now operating at
					<a href="http://fhirtest.uhn.ca">http://fhirtest.uhn.ca</a>. 
					This server is built entirely using components of HAPI-FHIR
					and demonstrates all of its capabilities.

				<b>Oct 23, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.7 Released</b> - HAPI 0.7 has been released!
				This release contains a number of contributions and bugfixes from all over
				the FHIR community. Thanks to everyone who contributed!
			</p>
			<p>
				In particular, note that this release corrects an issue where contained resources 
				sometimes got encoded as both contained and top-level resources, and top level 
				resources sometimes got encoded as contained resources. It is possible that some 
				existing applications depended on the buggy behaviour, so please do a bit of extra 
				testing on your server applications if you use contained resources at all. See 
				the <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/doc_resource_references.html">resource references</a>
				documentation for a bit more information on how these work, and please feel free to 
				post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/hapi-fhir">google group</a>
				if things aren't working as expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				This release also introduces a fascinating <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>
				based development environment contributed by Preston Lee which should allow you 
				to try out a fully functional, database backed HAPI server in a virtual server 
				on your own development box.
			</p>

				See the <a href="http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/changes-report.html">changelog</a>
				for a complete list of what's new!

				<b>Sep 8, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.6 Released</b> - A new build has been uploaded,
				containing a number of new features and bug fixes. See the changelog
				for a complete list of what has changed.

			<p>
				<b>July 30, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.5 Released</b> - HAPI 0.5 has now been released.
				This is surprisingly soon after the last release (and probably not a 
				pace we will sustain) but we landed a number of big fixes and enhancements
				over the last two weeks and it just didn't make sense to hold them.
				See the <a href="./doc_upgrading.html">upgrading page</a> for information on 
				API changes in this release.

			<p>
				<b>July 14, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.4 Released</b> - The next release of HAPI has been
				tagged an uploaded to the Maven global repos and the GitHub releases section. See the changelog
				for more information. This release contains a large number of minor bugfixes and quite a few new
				features. Upgrading should be relatively simple, although there is one breaking API change (IdDt
				now can contain the complete URL of a resource, not just the logical ID).

			<p>
				<b>May 12, 2014 - HAPI FHIR 0.3 Released</b> - A new release of HAPI FHIR has been deployed
				to the Maven repos and the Sourceforge download system. This release corrects a large number of 
				bugs and includes fixes which were implemented in the recent FHIR Connectathon.

		<section name="What is HAPI FHIR?">
			<p>
				HAPI FHIR is a simple-but-powerful library for adding FHIR messaging to your application. It
				is pure Java (1.6+ compatible), and licensed under the business-friendly Apache Software
				License, version 2.0.
			</p>
			
			<subsection name="Multiple Usage Patterns">
				<p>
					HAPI is designed with one main intent: providing a flexible way of adding
					FHIR capability to applications. We at <a href="http://www.uhn.ca">University Health Network</a> 
					developed HAPI-FHIR to allow us to 
					build up our own unified FHIR RESTful server which exposes data backed by
					a number of systems and repositories, so it is designed to be flexible
					above all else. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The library is designed to support several main usage patterns:
					<img src="images/hapi-usage.png" alt="HAPI Usage Patterns"/>  
				</p>
			</subsection>
						
			<subsection name="Fluent Interface">
			
				<p>
					The HAPI API is designed to allow interaction with 
					FHIR model objects using a convenient
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">Fluent Interface</a>.
				</p>
				<source><![CDATA[Patient patient = new Patient();
patient.addIdentifier().setUse(OFFICIAL).setSystem("urn:fake:mrns").setValue("7000135");
patient.addIdentifier().setUse(SECONDARY).setSystem("urn:fake:otherids").setValue("3287486");

patient.addName().addFamily("Smith").addGiven("John").addGiven("Q").addSuffix("Junior");

patient.setGender(AdministrativeGenderCodesEnum.M);]]></source>

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Encoding Support">
						
				<p>
					Both XML and JSON encoding are suported natively using a simple API
					to pick between them. XML support is built on top of the lightning-fast 
					<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/stax/why.html">STaX/JSR 173</a> 
					API, and JSON support is provided using the new
					<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353">javax.json/JSR-353</a> API. 
				</p>
	
				<source><![CDATA[FhirContext ctx = new FhirContext();
String xmlEncoded = ctx.newXmlParser().encodeResourceToString(patient);
String jsonEncoded = ctx.newJsonParser().encodeResourceToString(patient);
]]></source>

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Easy RESTful Client and Servers">

				<p>
					Creating clients is simple and uses an annotation based format
					that will be familiar to users of JAX-WS.
				</p>
				
				<source><![CDATA[public interface MyClientInterface extends IRestfulClient
{
  /** A FHIR search */
  @Search
  public List<Patient> findPatientsByIdentifier(@RequiredParam(name="identifier") IdentifierDt theIdentifier);
	
  /** A FHIR create */
  @Create
  public MethodOutcome createPatient(@ResourceParam Patient thePatient);
}]]></source>

				<p>
					Using this client is as simple as:
				</p>
				
				<source><![CDATA[MyClientInterface client = ctx.newRestfulClient(MyClientInterface.class, "http://foo/fhir");
IdentifierDt searchParam = new IdentifierDt("urn:someidentifiers", "7000135");
List<Patient> clients = client.findPatientsByIdentifier(searchParam);]]></source>
